# QcKPrism - A SteelSeries QcK Prism Cloth XL controll utility

Since SteelSeries does not provide ways to control their QcK Prism Cloth XL under linux (SteelSeries Engine Software is available only under Windows or MacOS).
I didn't want to stay stuck with default lighting, so i made this simple utility allow a simple RGB control. 
This cli-utility was made with linux in mind, but since it's 100% rust code - it works on windows as well. 

For now i only support one device kind :
>VendorID: 0x1038

>ProductID : 0x150d

Because I don't have any way to test if it works on other VID/PID devices from steelseries.
